Hi everyone, it’s great to meet you all, and thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself.

My name is Damon Young, and I’ve been working as a Front-End Developer for over 7 years.

During my master's degree, I developed a strong interest in web development, 
especially in how websites and web apps are created and how they improve user experience. 
This led me to decide to pursue it as a career.

I have a lot of experience building web applications at my previous companies, 
including e-commerce platforms, banking reward systems, and several admin management systems. 
I’ve worked on everything from user-facing front-end pages to simple admin dashboards and back-office tools, 
making sure everything runs smoothly for both users and internal teams.

I’m comfortable working with modern JavaScript, TypeScript, React, 
and state management libraries like Redux and Zustand. 
I also have experience writing unit tests using Jest. 
In my previous React projects, I was both a key developer and tech lead, 
responsible for front-end development and improving the overall user experience.

In addition, I’ve contributed to the open-source project Ant Design Mobile, which has over 11k stars on GitHub。
My contributions include developing components, 
writing unit tests to improve coverage, and optimizing performance.

I look forward to contributing to your team and projects. Thank you!
